## Intro

Team Captain was designed for volleyball coaches by a volleyball coach. With so many moving parts, tryouts are usually a daunting event to get through. There is already so much to prepare for and stress about during the season - tryouts should not be one of those stress-inducers. 

With Team Captain, you can have the power of in-depth analysis of each player and your teams right at the tip of your finger.

##### Next Steps/Unsolved Issues

* **Coach Assignments** - Allow for a master admin coach that can assign coaches a pass to login. At this time, the website is open for anyone to signup for an account and view the current team's page. To ensure the safety of the kids, **this needs to be resolved immediately**.

* **Theme Continuity** - Mismatched action buttons that need to match the theme and style of the other pages. Not of immediate concern but a quick fix. 

##### Updates/Planned Feautures

* **Players Index Display Options** - On top of the display as a list, Coaches will have the ability to display all players in individual cards with quick bios (trading card style). 

* **Sort By** - Allow coaches the ability to sort players by grades, last names, teams, etc.

* **Team Schedule** - Addition of upcoming schedule and previous game snapshot right on the dashboard.

* **Team Assignments** - Allow the coach the ability to assign teams to other coaches, where they can view their teams.
